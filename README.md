# Trailhead Frontend
This repo will hold our react.js frontend parts of our COSC 98 project

To get our hello world started: `npm start`

## Architecture

We plan to code using react.js
NB: we had to remove the camal casing due to the warning: "name can no longer contain capital letters"

React.js for user interface, React Router for page navigation, and either Axios or Fetch API for calling the backend APIs is we use any. 

## Designs
